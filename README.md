Thanking Sentdex(YouTube channel) for helping in the understanding of the code.
This Game is made simply on Pygame.The main moto of the game building was to just create a simple game, so we can apply 
Reinforcement Learning Algorithm and train the model, so that it could reach an expert level, starting from scratch.

Game.py- It is the most version of the game.For people planning to start, this is the place.
Game_1.py-A bit advanced version of Game.py
Game_2.py- Final version of the game that we will be using for the Algo Application
